Things to do:

--> 
--> other person sharing new video and if autoshare is turned off then stop syncing that video on client 
--> share video event should be successful once it is received back from server and not sent to pop up directly
--> join link doesn't start with the correct time poll for time 
--> video double loop pause while playing pause 



day 2)

--> fix time start for new joinee
--> share button not working properly 
--> video back and forth milliseconds issue


day 3) 
--> fix multiple login  --> done more or less
--> autoshare fix  --> done more or less
--> move all local storage items to background script  --> done more or less

--> time jig jig ---> somewhat done 
--> youtube playlist fix  --> 
--> disconnect afk sockets   --> 
--> new joinee start time fix again
--> unsynced 


--> get time when no tab synced or unsynced handle
